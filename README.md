# AutoCOPR

Work in progress!

## Thanks
- [VarLad](https://gitlab.com/VarLad/rpm-specs) for writing the
  [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) and [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) specs!
- [Atim](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/starship/) for writing the
  [Starship](https://starship.rs/) spec!
- The [python-rpm-spec](https://github.com/bkircher/python-rpm-spec) project -
  I needed to modify the spec so I didn't bring in this whole project, but this
  was a great resource!
